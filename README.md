# Datacamp-sales-project

This project is from datacamp competition. Here, I worked as an analyst in the accounting department of a company that sells motorcycle parts. A colleague wants to get answers to some questions so I will be helping her. The challenge is to create a report to answer her questions. Her questions are as follows:

1. What are the total sales for each payment method?
2. What is the average unit price for each product line?
3. Create plots to visualize findings for questions 1 and 2.
4. [Optional] Investigate further (e.g., average purchase value by client type, total purchase value by product line, etc.)
5. Summarize your findings.
