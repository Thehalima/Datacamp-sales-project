# Motorcycle-sales-project

This project is from datacamp competition. Here, I worked as an analyst in the accounting department of a company that sells motorcycle parts. A colleague wants to get answers to some questions so I will be helping her. The challenge is to create a report to answer her questions. Her questions are as follows:

1. What are the total sales for each payment method?
2. What is the average unit price for each product line?
3. Create plots to visualize findings for questions 1 and 2.
4. [Optional] Investigate further (e.g., average purchase value by client type, total purchase value by product line, etc.)
5. Summarize your findings.


The sales dataset was gotten from datacamp.It has 1000 rows and 8 columns with no null values . There are 6 unique product lines; Miscellaneous, breaking system, suspension & traction, Frame & body, Engine and Electrical system . The sales dataset also contains 3 unique warehouses; Central, North, and west. . The payment method that brought the highest sales was transfer;  159,642.33,𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑; 110,271 and cash was the lowest;  19199.10.𝑊ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒 𝑏𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙.𝑤ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑑𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑜𝑓 709,52 and retail was  167.05.𝐶𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑚𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑎 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑓 141,982.88, then north with a total of  100,203.63 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 46926.49 .
