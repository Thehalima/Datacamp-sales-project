# Motorcycle-sales-project

This project is from datacamp competition. Here, I worked as an analyst in the accounting department of a company that sells motorcycle parts. A colleague wants to get answers to some questions so I will be helping her. The challenge is to create a report to answer her questions. Her questions are as follows:

1. What are the total sales for each payment method?
2. What is the average unit price for each product line?
3. Create plots to visualize findings for questions 1 and 2.
4. [Optional] Investigate further (e.g., average purchase value by client type, total purchase value by product line, etc.)
5. Summarize your findings.


# Answers to the questions

1. The total sales for each payment methods are : cash- $19.199.1, credit card- $110, 271.57 and transfer- $159,642.33
2. The average unit price for our products are:
  -	Breaking system		$166.74
 	-	Electrical system	$225.97
 	-	Engine		        $622.06
 	-	Frame & body	    $415.81
 	-	Miscellaneous	    $222.67
 	-	Suspension & traction	 $320.24

3. Plots are available in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Thehalima/Motorcycle-compay-sales-project/blob/main/Motorcycle-company-sales.ipynb)
4. The average purchase values are:
  - Retail $167.06
  - Wholesale $709.52

5. The total purchase value of each product line are;
   -Breaking system		$38350.15
 	-	Electrical system	$43612.71
 	-	Engine		        $37945.38
 	-	Frame & body	    $69024.73
 	-	Miscellaneous	    $27165.82
 	-	Suspension & traction	 $73014.21

I went further to do some investigations. 
I discovered the frequency at which the warehouses were used. 
Another interesting thing I uncovered was that even though payment by credit card was used the most, with a count of 659, payment by transfer method brought in the highest sales.Lastly, the highest sales was made in the month of August.
-June $95,320.03
-July $93,547.91
-August $100,245.06
